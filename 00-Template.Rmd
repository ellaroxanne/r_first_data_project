# Variables 

What are variables? blah blah blah 

Make a variable with each data type. 

Experiment with what they do. 
## Integers

Integers are our countable numbers. Let's write one. 

```{r}
my_integer <- 8
```

You can add integers. 
## Strings

## Floats

## Booleans

## What's next

There are more complicated datatypes, such as datetime, nan, whatever. This is too in the weeds for right now, don't worry about it. 

# Functions

If variables are making nouns, functions are making verbs. 

Basic function like multiply by 2. Print a random number.
